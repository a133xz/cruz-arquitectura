# Cruz Arquitectura

As usual with most of my sometime-aside-projects, a very good friend (Cruz Arquitectura) asked me for nice a website to upload the portfolio. I remembered that [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me/) did something super cool for his Photography so I've used his site with a few small tweaks. So thank you, Daniel.

## Future

We'll build a new website in the future but for now, meets the requirements.
